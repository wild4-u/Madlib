Mad Lib Project

## Description
This is a simple and fun Python project that generates a joke using user input to fill in the blanks. The user is asked to provide different types of words (like animals, places, verbs, adjectives, etc.), and the program creates a funny story based on their input.

## How It Works
The program asks the user for several inputs (e.g., animal names, places, objects), and these words are inserted into a pre-defined joke template. The final result is a customized joke that changes depending on what the user enters.
